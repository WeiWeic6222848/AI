This repository implements the sequence and time aware neighborhood for session-based recommendations using sparse matrix, which is more efficient for sessions with large items in comparison to the python native implementations.

To run the predictions:
Ensure dataset is downloaded and located in '.\folds'
dataset location: 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eBEZKyNCKzMty2uMnyOZiWsASwlv33lQ/view'

install requirements via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

execute AI.py to run the newly implemented STAN algorithm on the train and test set of each folds.
